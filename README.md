## About Me
I hold a degree in Psychology and a postgraduate specialization in Public Health, with an emphasis on Health Planning and Management. After 10 years working within the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS), I developed a passion for Epidemiologyâ€”a field that combines Public Health knowledge, biostatistics, and data analysis to investigate disease distribution and identify risk factors within populations. I am currently transitioning into Data Analysis, and my skill set includes SQL, Power BI, Python, R, and Excel.
